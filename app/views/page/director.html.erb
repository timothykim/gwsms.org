<h2>About the Director</h2>

<p>The Institute Offers this wonderful program under the instruction of Hannah Choi, who earned her Bachelor of Music degree in Violin Perfromace at University of Maryland, having studied with James Stern, Ignace Jang, Dan Rizner and Sergiu Schwartz. Her career goal of educating children solidified after her concert tour of Spain and France with the DePauw University Symphony Orchestra, where she studied with Dan Rizner under full scholarship. Ms. Choi has pursued the long term study of Suzuki pedagogy at the University of Maryland under Ronda Cole, and is certified to teach Suzuki Pre-twinkles through Book 8. She has also completed the Suzuki Every Child Can enrichment course and has studied techniques for teaching Suzuki group classes under Edmund Sprunger. Her other studies have included Music Mind Games with Michiko Yurko at School for Strings in New York. Ms. Choi's strongest performance interest is in chamber music, having studied with Eric Edberg, David Salness, Evelyn Elsing and the Ying Quartet. Her performance credits range from television broadcast in Hawaii (KHNL News 8, KHON 2 Fox), recitals churches, nursing homes, public schools and kindergartens. Her greatest joy is to share music with those who might not otherwise have the opportunity to hear it and uncover in them an interest in it.</p>
